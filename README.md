# Learn Termux

This is the course material to accompany the 'Fast Track Learning Web App Development on an android device with Termux' 

## Why develop on a tablet?
Why not? Why do we as developers have to carry around laptops when we can use an 8-inch tablet that fits in our jacket pocket. On top of that being able to develop when out and about and not worrying about whether we have internet or not is a bonus. 
Well, it has become possible thanks to the team behind Termux.

## Why this course
Being prototype and production developers in live environments we understand the need to quickly learn production ready knowledge without having to go through the traditional courses full of theoretical fluff. 
What makes this course different?
Working experience. We do this everyday. Development is not just a job for us. We live it. We have to learn fast and then develop to meet deadlines. We teach techniques you will actually use not nice to know stuff.
Plus Ray uses his Huewei MediaPad M5 8 with Termux on a daily basis working on prototypes and products for our clients. Everything in this course is tried and tested on several different Android tablets including: Samsung Note 8, Lenovo Tab 4 10, Amazon Kindle Fire 8 HD. Yes and Kindle Fire HD!  

## What you will need for this course
An Android tablet with at least version 7. If you are only building HTML/PHP and essential Node apps you can get away with a lower version of Android. You also have to have the Chrome browser installed. 

## How to use this course
This course is a fast track course aimed at getting you up and running with Termux quickly. We recommend copying and pasting the scripts where possible and then follow along with the explanations.
